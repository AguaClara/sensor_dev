It's been a while since we've logged what we've been doing, mostly because we've been looking into supplies.

**Week of April 21st**

Fabrication of the expandable ruler system:
The expandable ruler system replaces our original idea for the reel, just because the reel would not be able to straighten out the
semi-rigid cable for the endoscope. We are using panels connected by hinges with loops on the side to hold the endoscope cable.
The panels will be marked like a ruler so that we can read the height. Some comments on the system:
  - Single hinges didn't work for us, so we may have to use double hinges.
  - In future prototypes, may be thinner.
  
Fabrication of the endoscope attachment:
  - We've found a temporary solution to our matte surface, and also, Hannah's computer case also absorbs almost all light, and we
  realise that color won't be much of a concern for us since it will be greyscaled anyways.
  - We've bought thick wires for the prongs, and also looked for some matte paint, but it is no longer necessary and anyways the most
  matte paint was not good enough.
  - We still need some cylinder shaft collar that will wrap around, and also we need to weld the metal together. 
  
Regarding the light gain problem, we've decided to just black out one half of the endoscope camera and use that as a control since we
can't access the light gain code from the developers of the endoscope. We're still looking for the best way to do that since black tape seems 
not to work as well as we'd like.
