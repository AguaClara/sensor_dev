# Week 5

We've started preliminary testing using the turbidity sensor after some minor issues regarding connectivity.
We realized that the relation they gave us only works for the voltage range of 2.5-4.2 so we need to set boundaries to make sure we have
a value that makes sense, or output a print statement that accurately shows the lack of information anywhere outside the range.


We've also got our hands on an arduino add on board which could allow us to use bluetooth instead of a cable if we buy an addon.
We got ourselves two pushbuttons from this board but we may need more?

Also we may not need the pushbutton yet, we can just use the reset button and have it determine the offset when we reset manually.



THINGS TO DO/ASK:

Is the floc hopper tube smooth?
Also since it's slanted how exactly we are measuring sludge blanket height.
Ask about dark colored sediments
