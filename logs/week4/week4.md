  - Work on testing the turbidity sensor using arduino and code
  - Adjust the relation as necessary
  - Play around with endoscope, maybe start to write pseudocode.
  - Make larger container with matte dark walls and bottom.
  
  
  
  We got access to the maker lab after the training. They have an arduino thankfully so we'll use that for the turbidity sensor.
  We also did some preliminary testing using the endoscope. Mostly trying it out in vials and seeing how it works. The problem is that the 
  LED gives off a reflection so we need a bigger matte wall tank that won't light up.
