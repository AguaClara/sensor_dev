        "Sensor Development's goal is to develop affordable sensors with readily available materials to monitor and report water quality in the water treatment processes in AguaClara plants and labs. In Fall 2019, the subteam worked on two different projects that were slight modifications from the previous semester. The subteam worked on a second prototype of the submersible Sludge Blanket Detector. Additionally, the subteam also started designing a low-cost turbidimeter that would measure the amount of dissolved organics as well as turbidity."

        "## Introduction\n",
        "The Sensor Development subteam creates sensors that monitor and report water quality during the water treatment process in AguaClara plants. While turbidimeters exist in the market, they cost upwards of $2000 USD and are often complicated to use. This subteam strives to create affordable and user-friendly sensors with readily available and replaceable parts. The goal is to streamline the measurement process, ensuring that it is not only user-friendly but also accurate. These sensors quantify the effectiveness of the treatment process by measuring the turbidity of the water at different stages of the treatment process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam started testing a prototype of the submersible Microcontroller-Interfaced Analog (MIA) sensor, which determines when the sludge blanket levels are rising. The ultimate goal for this sensor was to provide the plant operators with a cost-efficient and simple way to determine the height of the sludge blanket inside the floc hopper. This is critical to keep track of the rate at which the sludge blanket is rising. As a result, the floc hopper has to be emptied fewer times and plant operation becomes more efficient. The subteam also started working on a prototype of the low cost turbidity meter for dissolved organics. This project has two main parts - the infrared turbidity meter and the 450nm sensor. This project has been modified from last semester, where the plan was to use an ultraviolet 254nm light sensor. Switching to the 450nm light made this project more economical, as the apparatus required for the UV light sources is more expensive. The turbidimeter is different from the team’s past projects, as it would measure both reflectance and absorbance of the light passing through the water sample. The subteam used an infrared LED and measured the light received directly across and at 90° from the light source. This resulted in a more accurate analysis of water purity, as it accounted for the absorbance of light. The primary use of this sensor will be to measure the amount of dissolved organics in the water - simply measuring turbidity wouldn’t suffice as dissolved organic matter is not always visible.\n"

        "## Literature Review and Previous Work\n",
        "In the Spring 2019 semester, the subteam continued work on the three projects from Fall 2018 - the Fluidized Bed Solids Detector (FBSD), the Mobile Application-Processed Endoscope (MAPE), and the Microcontroller-Interfaced Analog (MIA). The team tested the FBSD that was prototyped in Fall 2018 using 3D printing and embedded circuitry. The goal of this sensor was to provide the High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) team with a quick method of testing the concentration of clay particles within their testing parameters.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The team also developed a mobile application for the MAPE turbidity sensor. The MAPE turbidity sensor connects an endoscope to an Android smartphone and displays the live feed from the endoscope camera, using the light intensity from the images collected to determine the water turbidity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the subteam also finished the first prototype of the MIA sensor, which determines when the sludge blanket levels are rising. This sensor housed an analog photodiode (a semiconductor that converts light to electrical current), an LED light source, and a microcontroller inside a portable case. Similar to the MAPE turbidity sensor, the MIA sensor measured the fluid turbidity using light intensity. However, this sensor detected light passing through the fluid using a photodiode, which is more reliable and less susceptible to noise. The microcontroller reads the data from the photosensor and converts it into turbidity values using a relation established through calibration testing. This sensor served as a prototype for a larger device that would function similarly to the MAPE turbidity sensor, providing treatment plant operators with affordable and user-friendly methods of determining fluid turbidity and sludge blanket height. The ultimate goal for the MAPE and MIA sensors was to provide the treatment plant operators with a cost-efficient and simple way to determine the height of the sludge blanket inside the floc hopper. This is critical to keep track of the rate at which the sludge blanket is rising.\n",
        "\n",
        "A new project was also started that semester, with a goal to build a low-cost turbidimeter with two main parts - the infrared turbidimeter and the 254 nm ultraviolet sensor. The infrared turbidimeter would measure both reflectance and absorbance of the light passing through the water sample by placing two sensors directly across and at 90° from the light source. Accounts for the absorbance of light would result in a more accurate analysis of water purity. The team began testing numerous infrared sources and sensors. In addition, the usefulness of the 254 nm light was researched - this wavelength can be used to measure the amount of organic matter in the water, as organic matter absorbs 254 nm wavelength light. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Fall 2019, the MAPE app was revisited due to problems surrounding controlling the aperture and exposure of the endoscope, which was interfering with turbidity readings. After looking through the UVCCamera library, it was determined that the MAPE app could no longer be pursued as a viable option. It appears that the code regulating the endoscope's aperture and exposure is embedded in the endoscope itself, which would mean that an external application (i.e. the MAPE app) would not be able to create consistent lighting conditions for turbidity readings."

        "The Sensor Development team has begun work on fabricating the Sludge Blanket Detector. The original design was theorized to have a few problems and so a few things were modified. The outer surface area was changed to be completely covered in its surroundings so that less light would reach the sensor. More specifically, in the original design, the sensor was surrounded by a clear case all around. This allowed for outside light to affect the readings of turbidity by the sensor. The modifications will allow for the light absorbed to be purely coming from the LED and not from reflected or refracted light from the surface. Another change is moving away from using cuvettes to seal the sensor and LED. First, we attempted to use PVC in combination with PVC cement. However, after several iterations of sealing, we were not able to waterproof the sensor because it had too many joints. We finally used a CAD model of the submersible case to 3D print it using clear resin. This material waterproofed the design and provided us with enough clarity to collect data. Additionally, the case was more robust, resilient, and fit within the design constraints we were given. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the old plans for the sensor. \n",

In the 112.3 g/L and 85.7 g/L tests, the drop off occured at around 7500 ms and the voltage dropped significantly enough to determine the presence of the sludge blanket, which validated our hypothesis. In the 56.8 g/L test, the clay had not settled properly, which resulted in our sensor performing unpredictably.
