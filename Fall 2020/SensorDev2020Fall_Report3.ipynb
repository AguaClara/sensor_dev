        "The Sensor Development subteam aims to create affordable sensors that monitor and report water quality in AguaClara plants. While turbidimeters exist in the market, they often cost upwards of $2000 USD and can be difficult to operate. This subteam strives to create alternative turbidimeters which are affordable and user-friendly sensors with readily available and replaceable parts. With the goal to streamline the measurement process, Sensor Development ensures that the low-cost turbidimeter is not only user-friendly but also accurate. These sensors quantify the effectiveness of the treatment process by measuring the turbidity of the water at different stages of the treatment process.\n",
        "The subteam started researching and designing a prototype of the Sludge Judge Sampler, which determines the height of the sludge blanket. The ultimate goal for this tool was to provide the plant operators with a cost-efficient and simple way to determine the height of the sludge blanket inside the floc hopper, in order for them to more accurately gauge when the floc hopper should be emptied. Previously, the subteam consider utilizing a submersible sensor to detect the sludge blanket height; however, a sludge judge critically reduces the need to waterproof a sensor and would be less complex for plant operators.\n",
        "The subteam also started conducting tests with the low cost turbidity meter for dissolved organics. This particular turbidimeter is different from the team’s past projects, as it would measure both reflectance and absorbance of the light passing through the water sample by measuring light received directly across and at 90° from the light source. This results in a more accurate analysis of water purity, as it accounts for the absorbance of light. The primary use of this sensor will be to measure the amount of dissolved organics in the water - simply measuring turbidity wouldn’t suffice as dissolved organic matter is not always visible.\n"

        "\n",
        "The subteam will continue work from the Spring 2020 semester on a low cost turbidimeter that combines an infrared sensor and a RGB sensor for dissolved organics. The sensors measure light directly absorbed across and at 90° from the light source. A study in 2014 by Sampedro and Salgueiro determined that this method of impurity detection more accurately measures small turbidity. The backscattering of reflected light versus the light that passes in between dissolved particles precisely accounts for liquids of varying turbidites. It is important to note from a study conducted on turbidimeters that high turbidity water can not be as accurately measured due to increase in multiple scattering. This multiple scattering means that one light beam is reflected off of two or more particles. This is a challenge that will be approached through experimentation with various concentrations of dissolved organics. The Sampedro and Salgueiro study also showed that an RGB sensor can be used to identify the dissolved particles, allowing for improved performance on colored samples and effective water treatment for many dissolved organic types.\n",

        "The subteam will also begin in depth research on a method to detect the height of the floc blanket in the floc hopper when it becomes saturated. The goal for this project is to research a cost-efficient and modified sludge judge that measures the settleable solids, or the sludge blanket. A patented sludge judge is priced around $200-300 USD market value; therefore, the ultimate goal is to produce a customized version of the sludge judge tailored to the AguaClara plants. This device is critical for determining the rate at which the sludge blanket is rising and contributes to the larger benefit of more efficient plant operation."

        "\n",
        "During the last semester, the main goal of the sensor development team was to do research on an affordable, open-source turbidimeter. Turbidimeters are crucial to safe-water technology as they measure the cloudiness of a fluid medium - water. Initially, the subteam began working on a prototype of a low cost turbidity meter for dissolved organics. This project has two main parts - the infrared turbidity meter and the 450nm sensor. This project has been modified, where the original plan was to use an ultraviolet 254nm light sensor. Switching to the 450nm light made this project more economical, as the apparatus required for the UV light sources is more expensive. The team further improved on the project by creating a case using a 3D printer which the sampled dissolved organics will be held while being read by the sensor. Our team will continue this project by constructing the IR sensor and doing tests with varied concentrations of dissolved organics. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam also started with testing a prototype of the Submersible Microcontroller-Interfaced Analog sensor, which determines the height of the sludge blanket. The ultimate goal for this sensor was to provide the plant operators with a cost-efficient and simple way to determine the height of the sludge blanket inside the floc hopper. This is critical to maximize efficiency as instead of guessing when to empty the floc hopper, plant operators can use this sensor to determine the height of the sludge blanket and only empty it when needed. The issue that arose from this was how to physically implement the sensor into the floc hopper. Thus, three main objectives arose: designing an independent system for the sensor to reduce set up time, determining the most efficient way to insert the sensor into the floc hopper, and setting a threshold for critical moments of operation. With more research, the team concluded that creating this sensor would not be optimal and began looking for another solution. They determined that a straight line pipe could be inserted into the floc hopper and function as a sludge judge. We will continue to research the pros and cons of implementing a sludge judge, and the overall design of the material in creating a substitute that fits our needs more effectively. \n"

A check valve, or a non-return valve, is a valve that only allows fluids to flow through in one direction . In this case, it would only allow the sludge and water to flow into the tube and prevent it from exiting the device. There are many different types of check valves: ball, diaphragm, and swing/tilting disk. Ball check valves are very common and can be made very small for very cheap. A free floating ball (usually metal but can be made of all kinds of material) is used to allow and block the flow of fluids, and a spring or reverse flow is used to keep the valve shut. The downside to using ball check valves is that they wear out or the ball can crack components given enough pressure, requiring replacement. \n",

        "###Dissolved Organics Sensor\n",
        "Based on the inaccuracy of the collected data for scattered light, we considered a few possible sources of error to test. It is possible that the infrared sensor that is being used is hyper sensitive to any light that is entering the casing through the one unfilled hole covered with masking tape. Additionally, the casing is a light cream color which is not completely opaque and could be altering the way light is absorbed or scattered. Another possible source of error is the settling of material in the solutions used for testing. If the samples were allowed to remain stagnant for extended periods of time after being shaken, then dissolved material could settle at the bottom and produce a consistently low scattered light value. Another variable to consider is how the wire connectivity between the Arduino board, IR laser, and IR sensor affect the intensity reading as we have had issues with sustaining active connections between each of the components. A final issue to consider is that we primarily tested the liquid with only one IR sensor; however, a second IR sensor should be incorporated to get a full reading of the water’s turbidity. These developments are important to AguaClara’s progress in the two sensor turbidimeter because the infrared sensor currently being tested will supplement the RGB sensor by more completely detecting the quantity of dissolved organics in contaminated water.\n",

        "In order to move forward with sludge judge prototyping and testing, we felt that the most reliable and easiest valve design to operate would be a plug attached to a string.This design would require the operator to have to pull the string up through the tube in order to plug the end. Although this design is simple, the reliability is still in question. While making the prototype, we must consider how secure the plug fits into the tube so that there is no leakage and also how to secure the string so that the plug does not fall out as the sludge judge is removed from the floc hopper. Nonetheless, these issues can be addressed once a physical prototype is tested and experimented with. Despite settling on the plug design for the floc hopper, the other valve and plug mechanisms discussed previously are still fair options that can replace the plug after testing the initial prototype. These final conclusions are critical in moving the sludge judge to the prototyping and testing phase so that sludge judges can make emptying the floc hopper more efficient for plant operators."

We plan on doing this while improving our overall design for more effective readings, as we had many errors within our most recent experiment regarding the measurement of light scattered when the clay has been completely settled versus when the clay has been mixed immediately before being placed in the sample cell box. We, unfortunately, achieved the same values for each experiment, which we concluded was an inaccurate measurement as we initially hypothesized a measurement close to 0 V when the clay had settled, and hoped to get a higher value when the sample was mixed. Based on the results we got in our most recent experiment, we are considering changing the source from A0 and A1 on the arduino board to A2 and A3, which would require us to alter the code previously developed for the arduino software in order to measure the light scattered and light transmitted. We also hope to be in a lab environment next semester to obtain a greater variety and quantity of materials, specifically longer wires that would stick into the arduino board more firmly, as the ones we have now are quite loose and require tape to be held down. Furthemore, we plan on simultaneously moving on to our next dissolved organics sensor, the RGB sensor, firstly beginning with its wiring set up and connecting it to the previously made 3D model of the sample cell box. With the RGB sensor, we will be using a blue light laser rather than an IR laser,  and repeat the same steps in measurement as done with the IR sensor. \n",

Certain designs could provide difficulties to plant operators and whether having a design that is fully internal or external can provide ease of use is one of the top priorities when experimenting with these prototypes. \n",

        "Although in the early stages of this project, the sludge judge has the potential of being a huge improvement to the process of emptying out the floc hopper. As of now, it is difficult for plant operators to track water quality inside the sedimentation tanks, especially to see the level of the sludge blanket in the tank, so that they can time tank cleanings. The sludge judge is the best solution, as it notifies operators when it is necessary to empty the floc hopper based on its measured reading. While a modern sludge judge is present in today’s market, they are too expensive and aren’t suited for the AguaClara plant conditions, which is why the team is developing a sludge judge to perform this task at a lower cost and with the design constraints of the plant itself. Thus, the current project of the sludge judge is vital to the AguaClara team as it would optimize an important aspect of the water-treatment system."
