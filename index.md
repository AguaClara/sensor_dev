# Submersible Sensor

Throughout the semester, we will update this page with current tasks, projects completed,
and other things we want to have easy access to.

## About Us

Our goal is to create a lowcost but efficient concentration detector by essentially hijacking 
cheap endoscopes/borescopes and merging its function with code and physical additions of our own.
By designing a mobile application that utilizes image processing and basic equations relating 
the image values to concentrations, we can both get a visual of what is going on in each level of depth
and determine using a threshold value where the sludge blanket begins.
