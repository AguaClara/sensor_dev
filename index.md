# Submersible Sensor

Throughout the semester, we will update this page with current tasks, projects completed,
and other things we want to have easy access to.

## About Us

Our goal is to create a lowcost but efficient concentration detector by essentially hijacking 
cheap endoscopes/borescopes and merging its function with code and physical additions of our own.


The current members of this subteam are Lois Lee (LL556), Srilekha Vangavolu (SV397), and Hannah Si (HS649).
