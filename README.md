## Semester Goals
* Our goal is to create a lowcost but efficient concentration detector by essentially hijacking cheap endoscopes/borescopes and merging its function with code and physical additions of our own. By designing a mobile application that utilizes image processing and basic equations relating the image values to concentrations, we can both get a visual of what is going on in each level of depth and determine using a threshold value where the sludge blanket begins.
