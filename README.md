## Semester Goals
<!---Our goal is to create a lowcost but efficient concentration detector by essentially hijacking cheap endoscopes/borescopes and merging its function with code and physical additions of our own. By designing a mobile application that utilizes image processing and basic equations relating the image values to concentrations, we can both get a visual of what is going on in each level of depth and determine using a threshold value where the sludge blanket begins.--->
Our goal is to create low-cost water quality analyzing sensors for in-lab and in-field use. Two projects currently being developed are the fluidized bed solids detector and the MAPE (mobile application-processed endoscope). The basic function of both these sensors is to relate absorbance or image values to concentrations.
